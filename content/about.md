### Me

![me](/images/me/me.jpg)


For anyone who found this website and now reading this paragraph, Hi! Nice to meet you!

My name is Zuoli Zhu, I am a grad student of computer science major from University at Albany. I will graduate and get my master degree in December 2019.

I finished my undergraduate in University at Albany with major in computer science and applied mathematics in spring 2018. During my undergrad studying, I learned extensive coding skills with Java, Python, and JavaScript, plus additional self-taught web development skills. I am learning the UI/UX design as well. I was one of the founders of an internatinal students' startup company. During the operation of that business, I used a lot of knowledge I learned from school into the real life. Time flew so fast, my friends graduated and they had to leave. And it is time for me to explore a new chance.

I am an enthusiastic web developer. I love the rise of the JavaScript and the open source community. I am keeping learning new technologies everyday.

Thank you for your reading! More projects can be found on my GitHub!
