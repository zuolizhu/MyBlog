For anyone who found this website and now reading this paragraph, Hi! Nice to meet you!

My name is Zuoli Zhu, I am a grad student of computer science major from University at Albany. I will graduate and get my master degree in December 2019. I came to New York in 2014 summer. When I walked out of the JFK airport, I knew here is the place I want to live.

I finished my undergraduate in University at Albany with major in computer science. During my undergrad studying, I learned extensive coding skills with Java, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, plus additional self-taught web development skills. I was one of the founders of an internatinal students' startup company. During the operation of that business, I used a lot of knowledge I learned from school into the real life. Time flew so fast, my friends graduated and they had to leave. And it is time for me to explore a new chance.

I am an enthusiastic web developer. I love the rise of the JavaScript and the open source community. I am keeping learning new technologies everyday.

I hope I can get an internship or a part-time job during this wintter. Thank you for your reading! More projects can be found on my GitHub!
